Guidelines for the Fee Adjuster Script

This script automates the adjustment of channel fees based on network conditions, peer behavior,
and local liquidity using data from the Amboss API and LNDg API.

Configuration Settings (see fee_adjuster_config_docs.txt for details):
- base_adjustment_percentage: Percentage adjustment applied to the selected fee base (median, mean, etc.).
- group_adjustment_percentage: Additional adjustment based on node group membership.
- max_cap: Maximum allowed fee rate (in ppm) for outgoing fees.
- trend_sensitivity: Multiplier for the influence of Amboss fee trends on the adjustment.
- fee_base: Statistical measure from Amboss used as the fee calculation base ("median", "mean", etc.).
- fee_delta_threshold: Minimum change (in ppm) required for either outgoing or inbound fees to trigger an API update to LNDg.
- groups: Node categories for applying differentiated strategies via group_adjustment_percentage.
- fee_bands: (Optional) Dynamic fee adjustments based on local liquidity for outgoing fees.
  - enabled: true/false.
  - discount: Negative percentage adjustment for high local balance (80-100%).
  - premium: Positive percentage adjustment for low local balance (0-40%).
- stuck_channel_adjustment: (Optional) Gradually reduces outgoing fees for channels without recent forwards.
  - enabled: true/false.
  - stuck_time_period: Number of days defining one 'stuck period' interval (e.g., 7).
  - min_local_balance_for_stuck_discount: (Optional) If the peer's aggregate local balance ratio is below this threshold (e.g., 0.2 for 20%), the stuck discount will not be applied.
- inbound_auto_fee_enabled: (Optional) Enables dynamic inbound fee adjustments. Can be set per-node or per-group. Defaults to false if not specified.
  - If enabled, the script will attempt to set a negative inbound fee (a discount) to incentivize rebalancing towards your node.
  - The discount is calculated based on the channel's `ar_max_cost` (auto-rebalancer max cost percentage, fetched from LNDg) and the current local liquidity band.
  - Higher discounts are applied when your local liquidity is lower (bands 2, 3, and 4), scaled by the `ar_max_cost`. No discount is applied in bands 0 and 1 (high local liquidity).
  - The `ar_max_cost` must be set in LNDg for the channel for inbound fees to be applied.

Groups and group_adjustment_percentage:
Allows tailored fee strategies for nodes in specific categories (e.g., "sink", "expensive").
Settings like `inbound_auto_fee_enabled` can also be defined at the group level and will be inherited by nodes in that group unless overridden at the node level.

Fee Bands (Outgoing Fees):
Adjusts outgoing fees based on local balance ratio, dividing liquidity into 5 bands (0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, 80-100%). A graduated adjustment is applied between the configured discount (high local balance) and premium (low local balance). The premium is capped at the 20-40% liquidity band to avoid excessively high fees on nearly drained channels.

Stuck Channel Adjustment (Outgoing Fees):
This feature incrementally reduces outgoing fees for channels that haven't forwarded payments recently.
For each multiple of the `stuck_time_period` (in days) that a peer's channels have gone without an *outbound* forwarding, the fee band is moved down by one level (towards the maximum discount).
The adjustment is capped at moving down 4 bands. If an outbound forward is detected, the stuck adjustment is reset.
If `min_local_balance_for_stuck_discount` is set and liquidity is below this, this discount mechanism is skipped.

Inbound Auto Fee Adjustment:
When enabled for a node/group and the channel has an `ar_max_cost` set in LNDg:
- Bands 0 & 1 (80-100% & 60-80% local liquidity): No inbound discount.
- Band 2 (40-60% local liquidity): Small inbound discount (e.g., 20% of `ar_max_cost` applied to current outgoing fee).
- Band 3 (20-40% local liquidity): Medium inbound discount (e.g., 50% of `ar_max_cost` applied to current outgoing fee).
- Band 4 (0-20% local liquidity): Large inbound discount (e.g., 80% of `ar_max_cost` applied to current outgoing fee).
The script queries LNDg for channel details including `ar_max_cost` and current inbound/outbound fees.

Usage:
- Configure nodes, groups, and their settings in `feeConfig.json`.
- Run the script to automatically adjust fees.
- Requires a running LNDg instance.

Command Line Arguments:
- --debug: Enable detailed debug output. Disables LNDg and charge-lnd file updates.

Charge-lnd Details:
Configure charge-lnd to use the output file for outgoing fees:
```ini
# charge-lnd.config
[🤖 FeeAdjuster Import]
strategy = use_config
config_file = file:///path/to/your/charge-lnd/.config/fee_adjuster.txt
```

Installation:
Add to crontab or use the systemd installer script:
```bash
crontab -e
# Add the following line (adjust path as needed)
0 * * * * /path/Lightning-Python-Tools/.venv/bin/python3 /path/Lightning-Python-Tools/Other/fee_adjuster.py >/dev/null 2>&1
```

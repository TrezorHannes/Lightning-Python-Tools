# Purpose: This script downloads a list of pubkeys which have an active channel-buy from Magma.
# It writes the pubkeys into a directory so my charge-LND can use this as a different ruleset.
# It'll remove the pubkeys once the channel-buy is expired, and then activate AutoFees in LNDg.
# It also enters Magma Active or Expired into the LNDg API as 'note' so it'll show in your Channel Dashboard

# Improvements: Identified too late into the script that I should naviate via channel-IDs instead of Pubkeys.
# This probably needs a whole refactor, which is deprioritized for now.
